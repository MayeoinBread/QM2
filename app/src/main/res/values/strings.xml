    <string name="backstory">Debt has run you out of your hometown, the great Salton City, capital of Koroth. You were once a great buyer and seller of services, picking the right man for every job.\n\n
    Following a series ofâ€¦bad investments, you\'ve gone broke and the Kylo faction is owed a lot of money. You packed up your things and rode as far north as possible.\n\n

You\'ve settled in Quagmar, rented a vacant space in the town and it\'s only a matter of minutes before you have sell swords looking to put themselves down for work.\n\n
